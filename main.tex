\item Lead, implement and own the SSO Self Service Portal(SSP) that shorten the implementation process from one hours to a few minutes. SSP can automatically retrieve submission history based on customer login credentials in homepage, automatically check the integrity of customer's submission, suggest protocols based on customer's submission to the general questionnaire, and automatically create standard SAML / OAuth / OpenID in Ping Federate by invoking APIs, store customer, application, submission details in AWS RDS. 

\item Lead, redesign and own SSO Login Page, serving for all applications and all employees in corporate Wi-Fi and VPN, compatible for PCs, MAC, and Mobile phones, plugin password changing self-service, big win for offshore Call Center reps who all had to call HelpDesk for resets every 60 days, bring UI pattern up to Capital One latest standards, dynamically display content based on user's IP that is inside or outside Capital One, add password-is-expiring and password-has-expired use-cases

\begin{rSection}{Project Experience}


\begin{rSubsection}{Python - Study of Stock Trading System(Technical analysis)}{Dec 2017}{}
\item Designed and implemented stock trading scripts to extract web stock data, created features, applied machine learning models, outputted evaluation results for model performance, made decisions based on prediction results.
\item Created visualization interface to identify real-time stock price patterns, calculated technical indicators, and suggested automated trades based on the findings.
\item Applied Black Scholes model to evaluate risk for option trading strategy, and validated the profit loss ratio result with real trading data
\item Applied natural language processing to extract useful keywords from public news for predicting stock movements.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Python - Study of Time Series vs Machine Learning Models on Stock Price}{Dec 2016}{}
\item Designed, implemented and compared traditional time series prediction models(Decomposition, Linear regression, Random Walk, Auto Regressive, Moving Average) with machine learning models(Naive Bayes Classifier, Bagging, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
\item Applied Yahoo Finance AAPL historical data as sample to compare the prediction accuracy rates, found monthly results perform better than daily ones. Naive Bayes performs worst since it is based on conditional independence and very poor on outliers.
